this should setup the windows and create the rendering context for the pathtracer 
the rendering context will *probably* be D3D9 but there is other choices possible..

- [x] rendering context for the pathtracing output
- [x] setup ImGui
- [ ] allow pt program to execute some ImGui (will get completed when the pathtracing class gets created)
